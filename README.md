# w3-playground

Webpage for prototyping webpages.

This project is for educational purposes only. It's based on the [TryIt-Editor](http://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_default) from [w3schools](http://www.w3schools.com).

**Modifications**

1. all the fuzz removed
2. requires no network connection
3. requires no local webserver

**Features**

Since the output frame is an iframe, you can prototype anything with it from HTML, CSS to Javascript.

## The not-so-known Marvels of Github

Github supports static hosting. The url to a static file looks like this:

```
https://rawgit.com/[user]/[repository]/[branch]/[filename.ext]
```
